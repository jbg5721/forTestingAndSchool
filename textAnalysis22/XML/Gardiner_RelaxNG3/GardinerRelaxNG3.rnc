#jbg: The xml document may need to be redone or reworked. It is missing a lot of key information and needs more tags. This is just a start.

start = xml
xml = element xml {metadata, introScroll, mixed{(setting | speaker)*}}
metadata = element metadata {title, release, director, scriptSource, talent, roles}
introScroll = element introScroll {text}
setting = element setting {where?, text}
speaker = element speaker {text}

title = element title {media, text}
release = element release {text, date}
director = element director {text}
scriptSource = element scriptSource {text}
talent = element talent {actor+}
roles = element roles { character+}

date = element date {when, text}
actor = element actor {text}
character = element character {alignment, text}


where = attribute where {"inside" | "outside"}
media = attribute media {"movie"}
alignment = attribute alignment {"good" | "bad"}
when = attribute when {xsd:date | xsd:gYearMonth | xsd:gYear}
