    <title>Country Loaf (Pain de Campagne)</title>

    <p>Washington author <per name="SamF">Sam Fromartz</per> has been making sourdough variations of this yeast bread for
        years. Here, he adds fermented cider for flavor. A mild beer may be substituted; an IPA
        would be too bitter. The loaf is sized to last a few days.</p>

    <p>The optional tablespoon of water is to compensate for the variable absorption of the rye and
        whole-wheat flours.</p>

    <p>You'll need a colander, a pastry cloth or clean dish towel and a covered cast-iron or
        enameled cast-iron pot.</p>

    <p>Make Ahead: The dough needs <time type="minutes">four 20-minute rests</time>, plus an <time
            type="hours">8-to-24-hour</time> stay in the refrigerator and a final <time type="hours"
            >1 1/2-hour</time> rise.</p>

    <p>Storage Notes: Store the cooled loaf in a paper bag for a day, and store in a plastic bag for
        a few days after that. Do not refrigerate.</p>

        <p>Whisk together the <ing>flours</ing>, <ing>yeast</ing> and <ing>salt</ing> in a mixing bowl. Combine the cider and water
            in a liquid measuring cup.</p>

        <p>Add the liquid to the flour mixture; use a spatula or bench scraper or your hand
            moistened with water to blend them for about a minute. The dough should be shaggy yet
            cohesive. Cover the bowl with a towel; let the dough rest for <time type="minutes">20
                minutes</time>.</p>

        <p>Moisten your kneading hand. If the dough seems stiff, add the optional tablespoon of
            water. Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the bowl), then press it into the center
            of the bowl. Repeat this about a dozen times, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the
            dough. (This should take <time type="minutes">1 or 2 minutes</time>.)</p>

        <p>Turn the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover and let rest for <time
                type="minutes">20 minutes</time>. Repeat the clockwise stretching and folding two
            more times, with <time type="minutes">20-minute</time> rests after each. Cover and
            refrigerate at least <time type="hours">8 hours and up to 24 hours</time>. The dough
            should have doubled. If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does.</p>

        <p>Lightly flour a work surface. Use a pastry cloth or clean dish towel to line a round
            colander. Dust the cloth with flour.</p>

        <p>Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to
            create a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom. Let it rest for
                <time type="minutes">5 minutes</time>, then transfer to the colander, seam side up.
            Cover with a towel and let the dough rise for <time type="hours">1 1/2 hours</time>.</p>

        <p><time type="minutes">Thirty minutes</time> before baking, place a cast-iron Dutch oven
            (lid on) or enameled cast-iron pot with a lid (on) in the oven; preheat to <degrees
                temp="475">475 degrees</degrees>.</p>

        <p>Carefully remove the hot pot from the oven.</p>

        <p>Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom. Use kitchen scissors
            to make 8 snips on the top of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about
            1/4-inch deep. Lift the dough and carefully drop it into the hot pot. Immediately cover
            with the hot lid. Bake for <time type="minutes">30 minutes</time>, then reduce the heat
            to <degrees temp="450">450 degrees</degrees>. Uncover and bake for <time type="minutes"
                >8 to 10 minutes</time> or until the crust is dark brown. Try to minimize the amount
            of time the oven door is open.</p>

        <p>The bread is done when its internal temperature registers <degrees temp="205">205
                degrees</degrees> on an instant-read thermometer and the loaf sounds hollow when
            knocked on the underside.</p>

        <p>Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool for at least <time type="hours">1 hour</time>
            before cutting.</p>
