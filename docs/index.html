        <div id="Tex" style="background-color:#85dcf8; padding:20px; div-align:right"><p>This has a much softer appearance compared to my portfolio site, looks like there is work for me to do. I just need to figure out how to properly align div text boxes like this one with images. I like this appearance but the code is not correct. This look is running off of abusing the float tag and margins. It would not be consistant if more things were on the page or I was in need of multiple different sized images.</p></div>
        <!-- jbg: On my computer and screen Oxygen says that "div-align" is not an error even though it should be. "div-align" is not a tag yet it is saying it is correct. Why!! it makes no sense -->
